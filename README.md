For this project, I analyzed task data from one of our teams. I was looking for insights on task quality measurement and how we can improve operational efficiency.

The two main questions I sought to answer were:
1) How does total resolution time (TRT) vary across members of the team? See if we can set a benchmark for this metric.
2) Is satisfaction score correlated with task volume? If so, use this to suggest when additional head count is needed to maintain high task quality.
